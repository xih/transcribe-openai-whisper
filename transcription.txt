 This is 1212 Jackson Street and the Nobbyl neighborhood of San Francisco. This is the second floor remodeled through bedroom and two bath apartment with condo quality finishes and laundry and unit. It has a large open living room dining room kitchen area with laundry room. This is staged furniture so the unit will be delivered unfinished. The bedrooms are large enough to fit a queen or queen sized bed. The main bedroom has an ensuite bathroom and has southern exposure for great natural light. This unit is pet friendly as well. This is such a great area to live in. You can walk to Pox Street in Chinatown, Huntington Square Park, the Faremont Hotel's famous Tonga Room and the top of the mark. There's a great neighborhood market just a couple blocks away. Come check this one out. Check my Link in bio for more details.
