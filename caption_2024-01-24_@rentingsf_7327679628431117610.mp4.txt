This beautiful classic corner apartment building is at 2242 Polk Street. It's in the Russian Hill neighborhood of San Francisco. Right 
outside your door you've got restaurants, cafes, bars, there's a crunch dim, a half of block away and there's Walgreens two blocks away. 
This building has laundry and unit, has an elevator. This unit I'm showing is on the top floor, it gets great natural light, partial golden 
gate bridge views and is remodeled. We do have four one bedrooms available in the building. Anywhere from 3295 to 3695 a month there's a 
$1,000 deposit special, $1,000 gift card movement special. Check my link and buy off more details and my email for tours. You got to check 
this one out.
